# QuizGameC
This is a basic quiz game I created during my Diploma in Engineering. It was developed in the C language and features a dynamic MCQ quiz system with 500 questions across various subjects. The application allows users to choose topics, generates random questions each time the quiz is launched, and calculates scores using file handling techniques.
